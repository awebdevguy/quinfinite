# QUINFINITE

https://quinfinite.web.app/

This web app uses the Unsplash API to download random images.

It scrolls images infinitely.

It initially loads 5 images to load the page quickly.

As you scroll down and nears the bottom of the screen, an
event is triggered and it will load an additional 30 images.

This can scroll indefinitely.
